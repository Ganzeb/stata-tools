{synopt:{opt esthi(string)}}  A numeric vector of upper bounds of interval estimates. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:estlo}. Multiple upper bounds can be entered. They must be separated by spaces. Typically the upper bound of a confidence interval can be used.

{title:Description}
{pstd}
This function computes the second-generation {it:p}-value (SGPV) and its associated delta gaps, as introduced in Blume et al. (2018).
This command and its companions commands ({cmd:sgpower}, {cmd:fdrisk}) are based on the R-code for the sgpv-package from {browse "https://github.com/weltybiostat/sgpv"}

{phang}
{opt esthi(string)}     A numeric vector of upper bounds of interval estimates. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:estlo}. Multiple upper bounds can be entered. They must be separated by spaces. Typically the upper bound of a confidence interval can be used.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt estlo(string)}     A numeric vector of lower bounds of interval estimates. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:estlo}. Multiple lower bounds can be entered. They must be separated by spaces. Typically the lower bound of a confidence interval can be used.

{pstd}

{phang}
{opt nullhi(string)}     A numeric vector of upper bounds of null intervals. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:nulllo}.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nulllo(string)}     A numeric vector of lower bounds of null intervals. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:nullhi}.

{opt nowarn:ings}     Disable showing the warnings for problematic intervals.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt infcorrection(#)}  A small scalar to denote a positive but infinitesimally small SGPV. Default is 1e-5. SGPVs that are infinitesimally close to 1 are assigned 1-infcorrection. This option can only be invoked when one of the intervals has infinite length.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nodeltagap}     (not implemented yet!) disable the display of the delta gap. Mainly used inside of {cmd:sgpv}, since delta-gaps are less useful to most users of p-values.  

{pstd}

{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}
{pstd}
The examples are based on the original documentation for the R-code, but are modified to resemble more closely the usual Stata convention.
