{synopt:{opt esthi(string)}}  A numeric vector of upper bounds of interval estimates. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:estlo}. Multiple upper bounds can be entered. They must be separated by spaces. Typically the upper bound of a confidence interval can be used.

{p_end}
{synopt:{opt estlo(string)}}  A numeric vector of lower bounds of interval estimates. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:estlo}. Multiple lower bounds can be entered. They must be separated by spaces. Typically the lower bound of a confidence interval can be used.

{pstd}

{synopt:{opt setorder(string)}}  A variable giving the desired order along the x-axis. If {bf:setorder} is set to {bf:"sgpv"}, the second-generation {it:p}-value ranking is used. If {bf:setorder} is empty, the original input ordering is used.

{title:Description}
{pstd}
Plot the second-generation {it:p}-value (SGPV), as introduced in Blume et al. (2018), for user supplied interval estimates (support intervals, confidence intervals, credible intervals, etc.) according to its associated second-generation {it:p}-value ranking.
This command and its companions commands  ({cmd:sgpvalue}, {cmd:sgpower}, {cmd:fdrisk}) are based on the R-code for the sgpv-package from {browse "https://github.com/weltybiostat/sgpv"}

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}
{dlgtab:Main}
{phang}
{opt esthi(string)}  A numeric vector of upper bounds of interval estimates. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:estlo}. Multiple upper bounds can be entered. They must be separated by spaces. Typically the upper bound of a confidence interval can be used.
A variable contained the upper bound can be also used.
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt estlo(string)}  A numeric vector of lower bounds of interval estimates. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:estlo}. Multiple lower bounds can be entered. They must be separated by spaces. Typically the lower bound of a confidence interval can be used.
A variable contained the lower bound can be also used.
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nullhi(string)}     A numeric vector of upper bounds of null intervals. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:nulllo}.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nulllo(string)}     A numeric vector of lower bounds of null intervals. Values may be finite or {it:-Inf} or {it:+Inf}. Must be of same length as in the option {it:nullhi}.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt setorder(string)}     A variable giving the desired order along the x-axis. If {bf:setorder} is set to {bf:"sgpv"}, the second-generation {it:p}-value ranking is used. If {bf:setorder} is empty, the original input ordering is used.

{opt xshow(string)}     A scalar representing the maximum ranking on the x-axis that is displayed. Default is to display all intervals.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nullcol(string)}  Coloring of the null interval (indifference zone). Default is the R-colour Hawkes Blue. You can see the colour before plotting via 
{stata palette color 208 216 232 }
{p_end}

{phang}
{opt noploty_axis}     Deactive showing the y-axis.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt noplotx_axis}  Deactive showing the x-axis.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nullpt(#)}  Default value is 0.0.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nooutlinezone}     Deactive drawing a slim white outline around the null zone. Helpful visual aid when plotting many intervals. Default is on.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt title(string)}     Title of the plot.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt xtitle(string)}     Label of the x-axis label.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt ytitle(string)}     Label of the y-axis.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nolegend}     Deactive plotting the legend.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nomata}  Deactive the usage of Mata for calculating the SGPVs with large matrices or variables. If this option is set, an approach based on variables is used. Using variables instead of Mata is considerably faster, but new variables containing the results are created. If you don't want to create new variables and time is not an issue then don't set this option. Stata might become unresponsive when using Mata.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt noshow}     do not show the outcome of the calculations. Useful for larger calculations.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt replace} replace    replace existing variables in case the nomata-option was used.

{pstd}
