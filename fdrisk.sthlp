{synopt:{opt intt:ype(string)}}  Class of interval estimate used. This determines the functional form of the power function. Options are "confidence" for a (1-\alpha)100% confidence interval and "likelihood" for a 1/k likelihood support interval ("credible" not yet supported).

{pstd}
{p_end}
{synopt:{opt intl:evel(string)}}  Level of interval estimate. If inttype is "confidence", the level is \alpha. If "inttype" is "likelihood", the level is 1/k (not k).

{synopt:{opt nulls:pace(string)}}  Support of the null probability distribution. If "nullweights" is "Point", then "nullspace" is a scalar. If "nullweights" is "Uniform", then "nullspace" is a vector of length two.

{synopt:{opt nullw:eights(string)}}  Probability distribution for the null parameter space. Options are currently "Point", "Uniform", and "TruncNormal".

{pstd}
{p_end}
{synopt:{opt alts:pace(string)}}  Support for the alternative probability distribution. If "altweights" is "Point", then "altspace" is a scalar. If "altweights" is "Uniform" or "TruncNormal", then "altspace" is a vector of length two.

{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}
{pstd}
This command computes the false discovery risk (sometimes called the "empirical bayes FDR") for a second-generation {it:p}-value of 0, or the false confirmation risk for a second-generation {it:p}-value of 1. This command should be used for single calculations. For calculations for or after estimation commands use the {cmd:sgpv} command.
