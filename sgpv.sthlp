{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}
{pstd}
{cmd:sgpv} allows the calculation of the Second-Generation P-Values (SGPV) developed by Blume et.al.(2018,2019) for and after commonly used estimation commands. The false discovery/confirmation risks (fdr/fcr) can be also reported. The SGPVs are reported alongside the usually reported p-values. 
An ordinary user should use this command and not other commands on which {cmd:sgpv} is based upon. {cmd:sgpv} uses sensible default values for calculating the SGPVs and the accompaning fdr/fcr, which can be changed.  
This wrapper command runs the commands translated into Stata which are based on the original R-code from for the sgpv-package from {browse "https://github.com/weltybiostat/sgpv"}

{opt q:uietly}     suppress the output of the estimation command

{phang}
{opt nulllo(#)}  change the upper limit of the null-hypothesis intervall. The default is 0.

{pstd}

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt m:atrix(name)}  takes the name of matrix as input for the calculation. The matrix must follow the structure of the r(table) matrix returned after commonly used estimation commands due to the hardcoded row numbers used for identifiying the necessary numbers. Meaning that the parameter estimate has to be in the 1st row, the standard errors need to be in the 2nd row, the p-values in 4th row, the lower bound in the 5th and the upper bound in the 6th row.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt altweights(string)}     Probability distribution for the alternative parameter space. Options are currently "Uniform", and "TruncNormal".

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt altspace(string)}     Support for the alternative probability distribution.  If "altweights" is  is "Uniform" or "TruncNormal", then "altspace" is a two numbers separated by a space.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nullspace(string)}  Support of the null probability distribution. If "nullweights" is "Point", then "nullspace" is a single number. If "nullweights" is "Uniform" or "TruncNormal", then "nullspace" is a two numbers separated by a space.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt nullweights(string)}  Probability distribution for the null parameter space. Options are currently "Point", "Uniform", and "TruncNormal". The default is "Point".

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt intl:evel(string)}  Level of interval estimate. If inttype is "confidence", the level is \alpha. If "inttype" is "likelihood", the level is 1/k (not k).

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt intt:ype(string)}  Class of interval estimate used. This determines the functional form of the power function. Options are "confidence" for a (1-\alpha)100% confidence interval and "likelihood" for a 1/k likelihood support interval. The default is "confidence".

{opt nomata}  deactivates the usage of an additional user-provided command for numerical integration. The numerical integration is required to calculate the false discovery/confirmation risks. Instead the numerical integration Stata command is used.
